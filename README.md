#Simple Lightweight Responsive Resume (HTML+CSS)
=================================

Not everyone is a front end developer and even among us, few of us really enjoy laying out our resumés. Portfolios are exciting, and flashy. Resumés are not, nor should they be. Nor should they be PDF only. 

While mobile phones and  tablets can view PDFs, PDFs aren't accommodating of screen resolution. During my job hunt, I was tired of attaching PDFs to e-mails and annoyed with some job application systems that asked for an optional Resumés, only to allow .doc format. I do not own MS office and wonderfully formatted Resumés in Pages lose their luster after conversion. It was time to address this problem.  

I developed a simple HTML/CSS resumé, with a simple grid system, with a few minor CSS3 effects. I can only testify that this is the resumé that landed me my current job. The current format is tailored to someone with several years of employment history. I intend to make a variation that places Education first for new-comers.

Project Goals: 

Create a simple, ultra lightweight atheistically pleasing resumé template. 
Ideally this resumé will only require basic knowledge of HTML. Job hunting is time consuming / stressful enough as it is writing and proofing cover letters, searching for jobs, interviewing. This template shouldn't make this process worse.
